***All the code accepts image as input***
Run main.py to directly check images through the web app.
Counter.py is best for regularizing straight line shapes.
Spline.py is used for smooth curved shapes.
Completion.py completes incomplete shapes using symmetry lines.
I have also attached GenSolve_Doc.pdf, which contains the complete documentation of the approach and the code, including the input and output for several test cases.
